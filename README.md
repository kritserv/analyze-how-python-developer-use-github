# An analysis of GitHub Usage of Python Developer and numbers of followers on GitHub

This research involved the collection of data pertaining to the usage of GitHub by Python developers. The data was gathered by searching Google for keywords related to Python-related occupations, such as `Python developer`, `Junior Python`, and `Senior Python` etc.

LinkedIn was utilized as the primary platform for this search, and through the exploration of multiple subdomains of LinkedIn, approximately 8,500 GitHub usernames were collected. Each individual user was then requested using the GitHub REST API for further analysis.

The objective of this research is to provide readers with insights into the behavior of Python developers with a high number of followers on GitHub. It is hoped that these insights can be applied to self-development studies, potentially providing a significant boost in oneâ€™s career, given that profiles with a high follower count are often more attractive to employers.
