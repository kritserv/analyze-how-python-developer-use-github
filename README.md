# Abstract

# Introduction

<ul>
  <li>This research involved the collection of data pertaining to the usage of GitHub by Python developers. The data was gathered by searching Google for keywords related to Python-related occupations, such as ‘Python programmer’, ‘Junior Python’, and ‘Senior Python’ etc.
  
  LinkedIn was utilized as the primary platform for this search, and through the exploration of multiple subdomains of LinkedIn, approximately 8,500 GitHub usernames were collected. Each individual user was then examined using the GitHub REST API.
  
  The objective of this research is to provide readers with insights into the behavior of Python developers with a high number of followers on GitHub. It is hoped that these insights can be applied to self-development studies, potentially providing a significant boost in one’s career, given that profiles with a high follower count are often more attractive to employers.

  <a href="/#1">[1]</a> presents the collection and mining of GitHub data with the aim to understand GitHub user behavior and project success factors by collecting information about approximately 100K projects and 10K GitHub users of these projects. They statistically analyzed the data, discretized values of features via the k-means algorithm, and the apriori algorithm to find out association rules.
    
  Project success was measured by the cardinality of downloads. They kept only the rules which had a download cardinality higher than a threshold of 1000 downloads. The results provide interesting insight into the GitHub ecosystem and seven success rules for GitHub projects.

  <li>
    <a href="/#2">[2]</a> analyzed how developers use GitHub Actions and how several activity indicators change after their adoption.
    
  The adoption of GitHub Actions increases the number of monthly rejected pull requests and decreases the monthly number of commits on merged pull requests. These results are especially relevant for practitioners to understand and prevent undesirable effects on their projects. The study contributes to the understanding and anticipation of the effects of adopting such technology, which is important for planning and management.
