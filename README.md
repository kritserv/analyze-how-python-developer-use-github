# Abstract

# Introduction

<ul>
<li>This research involved the collection of data pertaining to the usage of GitHub by Python developers. The data was gathered by searching Google for keywords related to Python-related occupations, such as ‘Python programmer’, ‘Junior Python’, and ‘Senior Python’ etc.

LinkedIn was utilized as the primary platform for this search, and through the exploration of multiple subdomains of LinkedIn, approximately 8,900 GitHub usernames were collected. Each individual user was then examined using the GitHub REST API.

The objective of this research is to provide readers with insights into the behavior of Python developers with a high number of followers on GitHub. It is hoped that these insights can be applied to self-development studies, potentially providing a significant boost in one’s career, given that profiles with a high follower count are often more attractive to employers.</li>
